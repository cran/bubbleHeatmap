Description: Plotting package based on the grid system, combining elements of 
    a bubble plot and heatmap to conveniently display two numerical variables, 
    (represented by color and size) grouped by categorical variables on the x 
    and y axes. This is a useful alternative to a forest plot when the data can 
    be grouped in two dimensions, such as predictors x outcomes. It has 
    particular advantages for visualising the metabolic measures produced by 
    the 'Nightingale Health' metabolomics platform, and templates are included 
    for automatically generating figures from these datasets.
